### Structural Gaps

- Geometry has two partial capabilities and therefore cannot satisfy the catalog-completion requirement.
- `G1` lacks the required property, oracle, intersection-matrix, implicit-representation, and predicate-adversarial evidence artifacts.
- The exact intersection matrix is not yet represented as a closed, auditable matrix.

### High-Centrality Topics

- `GEO-INTERSECTION-002` feeds topology, Boolean modeling, exact exchange, and the G1 verification gate.
- General torus-torus tracing is a representative coordinate-atlas problem: a geometric branch may remain regular while a chosen meridian coordinate becomes singular.

### Contradictions

- The source-of-truth contract requires exact or certified-implicit continuation, while the current general torus-torus fixture accepts a typed failure for an orthogonal symmetric case without first proving that the geometric intersection itself is singular.

### Runtime Finding

- Converting both complete tori to rational B-spline surfaces and invoking the generic bounded-surface intersector exceeded the five-minute test limit. This path is not a viable production fallback for the symmetric fixture.
- For congruent centered tori, subtracting the two implicit equations factors exactly into the two axis-bisector planes. In the orthogonal fixture the four plane-section branches meet at second-order contacts on the shared perpendicular axis; this is a geometric branch singularity, not merely a meridian-coordinate singularity.

### Next Actions

1. Implement the congruent-centered exact bisector-plane factorization using the existing certified plane-torus curve implementation.
2. Preserve explicit second-order branch contacts and exact pcurves for both source tori.
3. Keep the current procedural certificate for noncongruent simple-root cases and continue the broader intersection-matrix audit separately.
