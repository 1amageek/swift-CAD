# Geometry Conversion

## Purpose and Scope

Child of [CADGeometry](../DESIGN.md), with no children. Owns PARG.G6's common
admission contract for approximation, interpolation and conversion of analytic,
NURBS and procedural geometry to B-splines on a caller-specified source chart.
Topology, authoring commands and capability publication retain their owners.

## Responsibilities and Boundaries

Source protocols own finite domain admission, point/derivative evaluation and
outward continuous differential enclosures. Native adapters retain immutable
Curve3D/Surface3D values and prepared enclosure work. A mapped source must provide
these same guarantees; a point-only closure cannot authorize certified output.
The converter owns numerical candidates and independent admission against the
source, with position, angular tangent and geometric curvature allowances.

## Related Designs

| Design | Relationship | Contract Used | Summary | Cautions |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [CADGeometry](../DESIGN.md) | parent | geometry, parameter charts, differential enclosures | Native source values and interval arithmetic | Enclosures must cover complete boxes and knot sides |
| [SurfaceFitting](../SurfaceFitting/DESIGN.md) | depends on | fixed-basis constrained interpolation | Constructs an interpolation candidate | Discrete equality success does not certify global geometry |
| [Swift-CAD](../../../DESIGN.md) | used by | shared geometry APIs | Public consumers obtain certified geometry | Existing point-only fitting consumers require explicit migration |

  -> source/candidate continuous differential enclosure
  -> adaptive full-domain interval admission
  -> complete B-spline + certified error bounds, or typed failure
```

## Contracts and Invariants

- All comparisons use the identical source parameter chart, with no implicit
  conic reparameterization. Curve knot-side limits and every surface knot cell
  participate in the certificate. Curvature is evaluated only on continuously
  certified regular spans; inability to establish regularity cannot succeed.
- Position means Euclidean distance in internal length units. Tangent allowance
  is an angle in radians: curve tangent, and surface U/V tangents plus oriented
  normal. Curvature means absolute curve curvature or both ordered signed
  surface principal curvatures, in inverse internal length units. Second
  parameter derivatives alone are not labeled geometric curvature.
- Curve candidates have degree min(3, maximumDegree), interpolate requested
  positions, and use endpoint Hermite derivatives for cubic spans. Interior
  knots retain separate polynomial spans; error guarantees include both sides,
  without claiming unique curvature at a join. Surface approximation
  interpolates a tensor Greville grid with the selected degree. Explicit surface
  interpolation preserves the supplied template's basis and positive weights.
- Numerical construction and point residual checks never establish the global
  allowances. Sources are continuous in position with piecewise-bounded jets;
  outward enclosures include both knot-side limits. Outward interval arithmetic
  bounds entire cells. An enclosed anchor and the complete first-derivative
  difference bound position by the fundamental theorem of calculus, including
  derivative jumps; normalized tangent bounds
  and fundamental-form principal-curvature intervals establish geometric limits.
- The guarantee reports actual admitted upper bounds, degrees and control count.
  No candidate is returned before all cells pass. Exhaustion means this candidate
  was not certified; it does not assert global approximation impossibility.
- Existing MappedBSplineSurfaceFitter/SpatialCurveFitter sampled deviations remain
  candidate diagnostics. Their Wrap, Unwrap, Rebuild and Align consumers must
  supply mapped-source enclosures and invoke the common admission API before
  presenting those diagnostics as complete-domain guarantees.

## Runtime Flows

Approximation constructs successively finer interpolants. Each candidate is
admitted through the same certificate used for explicit interpolation and
caller-provided candidates. Only private candidate-admission rejection may refine within the supplied
budgets. Source failures, including a source-thrown public toleranceRejected,
evaluator failures and cancellation propagate without fallback.

## State, Ownership, and Lifecycle

Inputs and outputs are owned Sendable values. Prepared native source adapters
retain immutable decomposition. Operation-local budgets and traversal stacks
are never shared. There are no callbacks outside synchronous source requirements,
I/O, retained tasks, streams, shutdown operations or platform-specific state.

## Failure, Concurrency, and Constraints

GeometryConversionError distinguishes invalid input, resource exhaustion
and a candidate that cannot satisfy admission. A nonregular
box is subdivided; an unresolved singularity consumes the enclosure budget and
fails instead of publishing undefined tangent or curvature values.
Cancellation remains CancellationError. Structural geometry failures retain
their original typed errors. Callers own geometric allowances. Positive budgets
bound candidate count, output control points, cumulative scalar scratch charges,
work units and enclosure-box visits. Checked arithmetic charges storage and
construction work before candidate allocations; every traversal checks cancellation.
Source implementations own the cost and correctness of each enclosure request.
Nonperiodic native curve adapters prepare decomposition once. Periodic curves,
including rigid and affine images, restrict the actual requested interval before
decomposition, so negative and shifted cycles are never clipped to a fundamental
cycle. Periodic anchor queries are enlarged to a containing interval wider than
the existing parameter-domain resolution before constructing a finite restriction;
they do not require the restriction owner to accept sub-resolution geometry.
For ruled sources with two B-spline boundaries, the native surface adapter uses
the existing exact chart-preserving tensor representation for its enclosure while
retaining the original procedural value as evaluation authority. This removes
correlation loss from subtracting independently enclosed translated boundaries.
Source implementations retain ownership of their per-request cost.
Converter-owned target preparation and every full-box and anchor probe are
charged separately before execution. The target cost owner counts intersected
knot spans and bounds generated Bezier extraction basis arrays, homogeneous
controls, de Casteljau triangular levels, derivative arrays and surface tensors.
Probe charges sum actual derivative dimensions through third order. They include
homogeneous split triangular levels, both split outputs, scalar derivative arrays,
projections and the four-slot scratch arrays produced by interval multiplication.
Surface tensor dimensions shrink with each U/V derivative; polynomial coordinate
groups are reserved only when rational weights can require them. A one-patch
clamped tensor uses its actual preparation and locus-verification dimensions;
general extraction retains its conservative degree-dependent reservation.
Preparation reserves 32 work units per scalar; probe arithmetic reserves eight,
plus knot scans. These bound loop operations and interval arithmetic rather than
multiplying an unrelated flat visit count. Checked
arithmetic rejects overflow before allocation. Periodic target restriction also
reserves its expanded control and basis work before each request. The separate
512 scalar/4,096 work visit allowance covers certificate arithmetic and stacks;
it does not stand in for target enclosure allocations. Defaults allow
4,096 output controls, eight candidate layouts, 65,536 enclosure visits,
1,048,576 cumulative scalar slots and 16,777,216 work units. Each independent
budget may terminate the operation earlier than another; changing a budget
does not relax the geometric admission conditions.

## Verification and Change Impact

[GeometryConversionTests](../../../Tests/CADGeometryTests/GeometryConversionTests.swift)
owns actual analytic/NURBS/procedural conversions, discrete interpolation,
continuous geometric checks, malicious sampled aliases, domain/degree/control
limits, independent budget exhaustion, cancellation and immutable inputs.
The package task owns native/WASM runtime and consumer migration evidence.
Changes affect the CADGeometry parent index and mapped fitting consumers; their
claims must match the common certificate before G6 can close globally.
